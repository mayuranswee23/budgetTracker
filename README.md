# Description 

This project involves using MongoDB, PWA's and other dependencies to create a budget tracking application where users can track how much money they acquired after all the income and expenses are calculated. The chart displays a trend of how money is either added or deducted from their account and a table above shows the user a history of their transactions. 

# Installation
To install this project, clone the repo onto your local device and use npm install to download all the necessary dependencies. Then use npm start to initiate the application. 

# Usage
To use this application, the user first loads the application. Then, the user inputs the name and the amount of the transaction and selects whether to add funds or deduct funds. Afterwards, the chart is updated with the inputted data, displaying a trend of how the user's money is being spent, and the history of transactions is saved.
